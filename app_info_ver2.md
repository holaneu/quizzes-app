## Technical specifications
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks required.
- SPA using "Fragmentation using HTML sections" - each screen (view) is in a separate <section> tag. When displaying a specific screen, hide the others and make the desired one visible. Use universal function "navigateToScreen(screenId)" to navigate between screens.
- Define basic UI elements in CSS by classes. 
- Use CSS Custom Properties to define and use CSS variables. The main purpose is to define colors in one place as variables and then apply these variables within the CSS code to style UI elements. Here's an example of CSS code defining variables:
  :root {
    /* Primary Colors */
    --color-primary: #6c63ff; /* Main branding color */
    --color-secondary: #5753c9; /* Hover or secondary actions */
    
    /* Background Colors */
    --bg-main: #121212; /* Main background of the app */
    --bg-secondary: #2b2b2b; /* Background for cards, input fields */
    --bg-tertiary: #444; /* Background for badges, overlay elements */
  }
