## Technical specifications
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks required.
- SPA using "Fragmentation using HTML sections" - each screen (view) is in a separate <section> tag. When displaying a specific screen, hide the others and make the desired one visible. Use universal function "navigateToScreen(screenId)" to navigate between screens.
- Define basic UI elements in CSS by classes. 
- Use "CSS Custom Properties" for defining and using CSS variabls - main usage is for defining app's color palette. Example of the css code defining variables:
  :root {
    --primary-color: #6c63ff;
    --secondary-color: #5753c9;  
    --primary-bg-color: #121212; /*#1e1e1e*/
    --secondary-bg-color: #2b2b2b;  
    --primary-text-color: #e0e0e0; /*#fff;*/
    --secondary-text-color: #e0e0e0; /*#9e9e9e*/
    --inverse-text-color: #fff;  
    --list-item-card-bg-color: #2b2b2b;
